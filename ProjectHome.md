A-3 framework aims to provide the necessary tools to develop software architectures addressed to highly decentralized and dynamic environments.
It's main features are:
  * a hierarchical group-based approach as a mean to manage dynamism and decentralization
  * reconfiguration and management mechanisms implemented through aspect-oriented techniques
A-3 offers the building-blocks for self-adaptive algorithms and behaviors.

This of the framework has been implemented as a university research project using:
  * JBoss AOP
  * JGroups group communication framework
  * REDS publish/subscribe middleware
