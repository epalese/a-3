#A-3 Overview

= Introduction =

A-3 is a Java framework that aims to help and simplify the implementation of self-management capabilities in highly dynamic and fully decentralised distributed applications.

<h2> Problem Specification </h2>
<p>
Typically in enterprise software systems a single well-defined entity or a set of collaborating entities are in charge of providing self-management properties. This is possible because enterprise environments are often characterized by a well known and controlled communicative and informational structure.
Instead scenarios with an high degree of dynamism and decentralisation make impossible a centralised approach to system management due to the lack of stable and well-defined entities to rely on. 
</p>

<p>
The role of A-3 is to address these kind of environments providing the tools to: 
<ul>
<li>build a self-organising control structure to get rid of dynamism and to build an accurate view of the running system</li>
<li>inject in running entities behavioural changes in order to adapt the system to environmental modification</li>
</ul>
</p>

A-3 provides the middleware to implement in a totally decentralised environment  a Monitor-Analyse-Plan-Execute control cycle which is at the heart of a self-managing software system.
