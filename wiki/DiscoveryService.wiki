= Discovery Service =

== Introduction ==
The intended use of a discovery service in A-3 framework is to enable services to search for the components needed to perform their tasks. So in A-3 a service is supposed to put all the information regarding its identity and provided functionalities in a service descriptor and then makes it available for search through the discovery service.
The main features of Discovery Service are its extreme configurability in the type of manageable information and in the search mechanisms. Moreover Discovery Service can be configured to address distributed settings ranging from centralized scenarios, in which a node is in charge of mantaining the service, to fully decentralized scenarios in which all nodes in the system take part in service operations.

Classes and abstractions regarding Discovery Service span multiple projects (Figure 1 shows how the various components of Discovery Service are related and distributed between A-3 projects). This wiki will describe the top-level abstractions, giving only a brief look to inner details in order to explain and clarify some key concepts on which Discovery Service is based.

== Concepts ==
In order to facilitate the comprehension, it’s helpful to briefly introduce some key concepts that are at the foundations of Discovery Service mechanisms. 
First of all it’s important to say that Discovery Service is built on a publish/subscribe middleware: 

<i>The publish/subscribe interaction paradigm provides subscribers with the ability to express their interest in an event or a pattern of events, in order to be notified subsequently of any event, generated by a publisher, that matches their registered interest. In other terms, producers publish information on a software bus (an event manager) and consumers subscribe to the information they want to receive from that bus. This information is typically denoted by the term event and the act of delivering it by the term notification.</i>
